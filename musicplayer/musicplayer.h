	/* Important note about the lock:
	 To avoid deadlocks with on thread waiting on the Python GIL and another on this lock,
	 we must ensure a strict order in which we might acquire both locks:
	 When we acquire this/players lock, the PyGIL *must not* be held.
	 When we held this/players lock, the PyGIL can be acquired.
	 In practice, if we want this lock, if we hold already the PyGIL, we usually use this code:
	 Py_INCREF(player); // to assure that we have a real own ref
	 Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS
	 PyThread_acquire_lock(player->lock, WAIT_LOCK);
	 // do something (note that we dont hold the PyGIL here!)
	 PyThread_release_lock(player->lock);
	 Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS
	 Py_DECREF(player);
	 If we hold this lock and we also want to get the PyGIL, we use
	 PyGILState_Ensure()/PyGILState_Release() as usual.
	 We use this order because in the PaStream handling thread, we might just want to get
	 the players lock but don't always need the PyGIL.
	 */

	// Note: When enabling these, we expect to hold the player lock.
	// So while we hold the player lock, these can not be enabled from somewhere else.
	// These can be disabled though in unlocked scope.
	boost::atomic<bool> pyQueueLock; // This covers anything which would potentially modifiy `queue` or `peekQueue`.
	boost::atomic<bool> openStreamLock; // This covers the opening of a PlayerInStream. (Only because of FFmpeg issues. Maybe should be global. Should not be needed theoretically if FFmpeg would be safe.)
